-----------------------------------------------

 Quick reminder:

 + Within the vncviewer in observer2:
   - Start Kentools by opening a new terminal and typing "observer". The commands available will be shown at startup.
   - Start the database by opening a new terminal and typing "godb". The commands available will be shown at startup.

+++ First half program: DECAT

2023A-237157 (PI: Narayan, Rest)

Science Support: G. Damke
Observers: Karleyne Silva

+++ Second half program: Lin

2023B-662232 (PI: Lin)

Science Support: G. Damke
Observers: Karleyne Silva

-----------------------------------------------

==== First half of the night ====

DECAT: Start right after pointing is done.

Contact: the queue is usually organized by Armin Rest (check email address in internal Doc).

The group usually communicates through slack but not all the CTIO staff is there.

Scripts and observing plan is located IN A SEPARATE DECAT GITHUB REPOSITORY (https://github.com/gnarayan/decat_pointings) but updated locally in the observing computer.

You have to update the plan after confirmation that it has been updated (they tend to do it very close to the start of the night or even the night midpoint, if observing on the second half).

+++ UPDATING THE NIGHT PLAN FROM THE DECAT REPOSITORY +++
(*** Note that the DECAT repo is different than the "regular_programs" repository ***)

- If you are a git user (or if you want to follow the few steps below): The DECAT repository is cloned from git in the local machine at the observing room. You need to pull the latest changes from the repository, doing the following:

   1. Open a Terminal, then go to the home directory and type the command:

      [DECamObserver]$ cd ~/DECAT_program/decat_pointings


   2. Check if you are in the repository directory with git status:
   
      [DECamObserver]$ git status


      The output should show “#On branch main” in the first line.

   3. Next, check for changes in the repository:
   
      [DECamObserver]$ git fetch

      this will compare changes between the remote repository and your local copy.

   4. Finally, update any pending changes by doing:
   
      [DECamObserver]$ git pull
	
    (Only if you made a mistake with git):
        you can delete the whole repository and clone it again:
	
	[DECamObserver]$ cd ~/DECAT_program
	[DECamObserver]$ rm -rf decat_pointings
	[DECamObserver]$ git clone https://github.com/gnarayan/decat_pointings.git

- If you are not git user, you can download the full directory (in the main directory: Code → Download ZIP).
  There are many things there. You will be interested in:
  
  Observing plan: in 2023B/202308XX/202308XX_obsplan.txt   (replace XX by today’s date)
  Scripts: in jsons/
  There is a folder for each program in the DECAT alliance.

+++ DOING THE OBSERVATIONS +++

   The repository will have an observing plan with the UT date of the beginning of the night. Go to the directory that will look like the one below (CHANGE THE DATE!)
   
   [DECamObserver]$ cd 2023B/20230818
	
Next, just follow the plan in the text file. *Warning: many jsons to load through the night!!!*

*** If you are getting behind the program ***

   Check the instruction at the beginning of the DECAT night plan, it will tell you how to identify the objects that you can skip to get back on track.

*** If you’re having trouble finding a script ***
   Go to the jsons/ directory and use the "find" command in the Terminal.
   For example, to find the script for "C3" object, just run the command below and check the output:
   
      [DECamObserver]$ find . -iname “*C3*”

   Midpoint   00:46 -04  04:46 UT

==== Second half of the night ====

*** FIRST: IT IS MANDATORY TO UPDATE THE PROPID IN THE "Exposure Control" WINDOW ***
*** Use prop-id: 2023B-662232
*** In case of trouble, use last semester propid: 2023A-423737

Contact: Edward Lin (check email address in internal Doc).

Observing plan is very simple: 2-minute exposures in VR fitler (or r-band if VR not mounted) of a single field repeated all night.
There is a single script that should last the full half-night. It is a single block with count=140.

** Script from this git repository within 2023B-662232/ directory **

Alternatively, script in observer2 and in the Google Drive:

   ~/ExposureScripts/User_scripts/2023A-423737/JT1_0818_corrected.json

Script will have exposures for the full half-night. However, delete observations or load the script again if you are behind/ahead of time.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

   If observing on first half of the night:
      Field starts at very high airmass (if first half of the night). Start this program when the Sun is at ~ -12.5. There will be no vignetting by the lower shutter (but just).

   If observing on second half of the night:
      Keep monitoring the end of the night when the field is setting with the PF webcam and stop before vignetting, if needed. Also, check the total background counts of last image and stop if background > ~18k counts. To check the counts, go to Kentools terminal (the one with "prompt>") and type "load". Check the counts in DS9.

No need for standard star fields.

Observer support/telescope operator should be able to handle this program.

Finally, send the qcInv file to the PI:

    - From the database window ("pgtcl>" prompt), type:
       pgtcl> qcInvPrint

    - That will create a .qcInv text file with the night date. Copy it over SSH (scp) to the lasrem0 (remote observing room machine) and then email it to Edward.
