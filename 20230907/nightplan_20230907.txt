 Quick reminder:

 + Within the vncviewer in observer2:
   - Start Kentools by opening a new terminal and typing "observer". The commands available will be shown at startup.
   - Start the database by opening a new terminal and typing "godb". The commands available will be shown at startup.

==== First half of the night ====



The program contains "regular program" observing scripts specific for the night, and also a "backup_program" that is observed depending on night conditions (read below). The observers will connect to the regular Zoom link to help you monitor the conditions of the night to decide whether do the regular or the backup program. You need to start the “obsbot” within the observer2 to get the conditions measured for the last image, and share your Zoom screen with the program observers, who will take note of the numbers.

**** 
IF MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ARE NEEDED: Extended instructions/notes are available in the document "SHORT VERSION DECam Remote Observing Instruction" located in the "For Blanco Service Mode" Google Drive folder. The link to the folder is in the Firefox Bookmark's toolbar in the remote observing room machine.
****

A - Starting the observations:

0. Connect to the usual Zoom call. The scientific support will connect there, and likely someone from Merian too.

1. Check the prop-id for the program in the DECam Observer console.

2. Load the .json file(s) for the program:

   The regular program is in the 2020B-0288/ directory and very easy to follow. 

   - The json files are named as <DATE_UT>_<UT_TIME>.
   - There is (usually) one script per hour.
   - ** Pick each script according to the date and UT time, going in order by date/time. **
   - Start the program at Sun altitude -14 deg, if observing on 1st half of the night.
   - GUIDER: if observing in a narrowband filter (name start with "N"), then increase exposure time to 1200 msec.
   
3. Start the obsbot!

   The "obsbot" is a Python program that measures several parameters of the images during the night. To run it:
   
   a. In the observer2 VNC, open a new terminal.

   v. Go to the obsbot directory:

      [DECamObserver]$ cd ~/obsbot

   c. Run "bash":
   
      [DECamObserver]$ bash

   d. Start copilot:
      [DECamObserver]$ source copilot.sh
      
   copilot may initially show data from previous night, but it will automatically update once data collection starts.
   
   You can minimize the terminal running copilot (but know where this terminal is because you will need it at the end of the night).

   Note: If you do not see the plot updating, then check and make sure that the rawdata symlink under ~/obsbot is pointing to the Merian raw data directory:

   e. Check that the link points to Merian rawdata:

      [DECamObserver]$ ls -la
      
      => the rawdata symbolic link should point to the correct path: /home4/images/fits/2020B-0288/

   f. ONLY IF the path is wrong, then you have to set the correct path doing the three steps below:

      [DECamObserver]$ rm ~/obsbot/rawdata
      
      [DECamObserver]$ cd ~/obsbot

      [DECamObserver]$ ln -s /home4/images/fits/2020B-0288/ rawdata
      

4. Monitor the Guider exposure time:

   - Increase guider exposure time for narrowband filters (900 to 1200 miliseconds is OK). Start with 600 msec for N708.
   - If cloudy, you can go even for 2400 msec.
   - The backup_program may contain broadband filters. In that case, reduce exposure time to ~300 msec.
   - Reduding the guider exposure time is also important for crowded fields. You can ask the operator for advice/help.

5. Begin completing the ObsLog (see the "During the night" instructions below).


B - During the night:

1. Throughout the night, log every exposure in the “ObsLog” file. Get the seeing, sky background and transparency from the copilot plot. The ObsLog is a spreadsheet located in the "For Blanco Service Mode" Google Drive folder (link in Firefox Bookmarks' toolbar).

2. Check “t_effective” calculated in the ObsLog to check if we need to switch to the back up program (see details in section below).

3. **If the Teff is lower than 300s for N540 filter or 200s for N708 filter (i.e. 1/3 of exptime)** then we will switch to the Backup Program. If Teff is borderline (e.g. 250s for N540), take another exposure to see if conditions improve or worsen.

4. Check the pointing offset (bottom panel of copilot). If the offset is >~15”, send a pointing offset to the telescope operator


** SELECTING A BACKUP PROGRAM **

There are multiple json files in the backup program. You need to first open the file called "output.log" and scrool down to the text table titled "BACKUP FIELD INFO". The table lists multiple fields and the respective airmass at the UTC times on the first row. Pick any field with load airmass for the UTC time. You can pick any considering +/- 30 minutes from the listed time in the table (as long as the airmass is OK). 
** *   ***    ***    ***   *  **
 
C - End-of-night Procedure and Checklist

1. After the last exposure is complete. Make sure that it gets written in ObsLogs.

2. Find **the SAME terminal** where you ran source copilot.sh. Close the copilot figure and send ctrl-c to stop copilot.sh.

3. Run copilot to generate a table, do this through the VNC. In the terminal where you killed copilot.sh, run:
 
    [DECamObserver]$ python2.7 copilot.py --fits db_merian.fits
    
     this file is symlinked to /user/DECamObserver/merian/copilot_output/db_merian.fits
     
4. Copy the output db_merian.fits from observer2 to your local machine. If you don’t know how to do this, you can run:

    [DECamObserver]$ rsync -avzL DECamObserver@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/merian/copilot_output/db_merian.fits ./
    
	this will copy the relevant file to your current directory.
	
5. Upload db_merian.fits to /DataLogs/ (overwrite previous version, there is built-in version control)

        If there are any errors, open a new terminal and run copilot again following step 5 in section A.

6. Get an inventory table from the Telemetry Viewer Database (qcInv in database), save to /DataLogs/

7. Fill the CTIO end of night report.
