 Quick reminder:

 + Within the vncviewer in observer2:
   - Start Kentools by opening a new terminal and typing "observer". The commands available will be shown at startup.
   - Start the database by opening a new terminal and typing "godb". The commands available will be shown at startup.

==== First half of the night ====

 Propid: 2023B-307896 (but actually use 2014B-0404 -- IMPORTANT!)

Contact: Arjun Dey (arjun.dey@noirlab.edu), David Schlegel (djschlegel@lbl.gov)

Google drive with materials for this project: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AEaD-C8OoHBKUk9PVA

  Queue is filled by a robot (decbot) so it is pretty easy observing. However, there are several steps to do at the start of this program:

David Schlegel should send you by email the “strategy files” for the night which are called pass1.json, pass2.json, and pass3.json. Copy them to someplace in observer2 (for example, to ~/vivas/DeySchlegel/ )  Do not change the name of those files. The copy in observer2 is important in case the operators need to load the scripts.
David will also send a plan B script (in which exposure times are fixed). Use plan B only if decbot does not work. Decbot will dynamically adjust the exposure time depending on the conditions of the previous image. They pretty much prefer that way to go
Copy the pass*json files to the decbot directory. In a terminal:
       ssh -X -Y declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu   (get password from Kathy or any of the contacts above)
       cd ~/obsbot
       cp the pass*json files here. For example:
	  declsp@observer2% scp /user/DECamObserver/vivas/DeySchlegel/pass1.json .
	  declsp@observer2% scp /user/DECamObserver/vivas/DeySchlegel/pass2.json .
	  declsp@observer2% scp /user/DECamObserver/vivas/DeySchlegel/pass3.json .

To start the bot:
- SISPI: Setup SISPI with propID 2014B-0404. Do not use their new propID (2023A-*) because decbot does not have permission to send exposure request to SISPI with other propIDs
- Start a vncviewer (it is a special one, not the one we usually use). In another terminal:
	ssh -X -Y declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu 
	cd
	./bin/vnc
	vncviewer :1   (same password we use for :7 or :3))
        The above will open a vncviewer which will have 3 windows running. Do not close any. Some plots will be generated automatically once observing starts
- When the time comes, start decbot. To do that, in a terminal (ssh -X -Y declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu (get password from Kathy)), being at ~/obsbot/, run:
        python2.7 -u decbot.py --exptime=80 | tee -a decbot-2023-08-04.log  (CHANGE THE DATE WITH THE START OF THE NIGHT DATE)
	That will start feeding the queue with 2 exposures at the time
	Click Go in the Observer Console. And that’s it!
- During the night check the pointing and make corrections if values get larger than ~20 arcsec. You can see the pointing in one of the plots generated automatically in the vncviewer :1  (but do not use those numbers since they have the wrong sign to what the operators need. Better do center in kentools)
- Start/end the observing with Sun at -12
- At the end of night: (on the initial terminal you opened in your machine, not in the VNC)
	declsp@observer2% cd
	declsp@observer2% bin/end_of_night_no_internet YYYY-MM-DD firstScienceImage
	The end_of_night_no_internet script will close the vncviewer (do not close it yourself) and it will generate some summary plots. It takes some time. Be patient.
	Copy the resulting figures, say for 2023-08-04, to your computer: 
	     scp declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/observing/logs/2023-08-04/\*.png .
	Upload those plots to the Google drive above. Send an email with a summary of the night (any bad image? Anything in particular to report?) to the contact people above.

NOTE: if decbot fails, just run script pass1.json (in folder 2023B-307896). This option should be just a plan B because decbot will adjust the exposure time with current conditions. The script has a fixed exposure time.

 Change to propid 2023B-662232 (PI: Lin)


*** FIRST: IT IS MANDATORY TO UPDATE THE PROPID IN THE "Exposure Control" WINDOW ***
*** Use prop-id: 2023B-662232
*** In case of trouble, use last semester propid: 2023A-423737

Contact: Edward Lin (check email address in internal Doc).

Observing plan is very simple: 2-minute exposures in VR fitler (or r-band if VR not mounted) of a single field repeated all night.
There is a single script that should last the full half-night. It is a single block with count=140.

** Script from this git repository within 2023B-662232/(JT1_0825.json) directory **

Alternatively, script in observer2 and in the Google Drive:

   ~/ExposureScripts/User_scripts/2023A-423737/JT1_0818_corrected.json

Script will have exposures for the full half-night. However, delete observations or load the script again if you are behind/ahead of time.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

   If observing on first half of the night:
      Field starts at very high airmass (if first half of the night). Start this program when the Sun is at ~ -12.5. There will be no vignetting by the lower shutter (but just).

   If observing on second half of the night:
      Keep monitoring the end of the night when the field is setting with the PF webcam and stop before vignetting, if needed. Also, check the total background counts of last image and stop if background > ~18k counts. To check the counts, go to Kentools terminal (the one with "prompt>") and type "load". Check the counts in DS9.

No need for standard star fields.

Observer support/telescope operator should be able to handle this program.

Finally, send the qcInv file to the PI:

    - From the database window ("pgtcl>" prompt), type:
       pgtcl> qcInvPrint

    - That will create a .qcInv text file with the night date. Copy it over SSH (scp) to the lasrem0 (remote observing room machine) and then email it to Edward.
