-----------------------------------------------

 Quick reminder:

 + Within the vncviewer in observer2:
   - Start Kentools by opening a new terminal and typing "observer". The commands available will be shown at startup.
   - Start the database by opening a new terminal and typing "godb". The commands available will be shown at startup.

+++ First half program: Dey and Schlegel

  2023B-307896 (PI: Dey, Schlegel) -- *Use 2014B-0404 for SISPI GUIs*.

  Science Support: Alfredo Zenteno
  Observers: Hernan Rincon, Segev BenZvi


-----------------------------------------------


 Propid: 2023B-307896 (but actually *use 2014B-0404* -- IMPORTANT!)

Contact: Arjun Dey, David Schlegel (email addresses in Calendar)

Google drive with materials for this project available in web browser's toolbar in observer's machine.

  Queue is filled by a robot (decbot) so it is pretty easy observing. However, there are several steps to do at the start of this program:

David Schlegel should send you by email the “strategy files” for the night which are called pass1.json, pass2.json, and pass3.json. Copy them to someplace in observer2 (for example, to ~/vivas/DeySchlegel/ )  Do not change the name of those files. The copy in observer2 is important in case the operators need to load the scripts.
David will also send a plan B script (in which exposure times are fixed). Use plan B only if decbot does not work. Decbot will dynamically adjust the exposure time depending on the conditions of the previous image. They pretty much prefer that way to go.
Copy the pass*json files to the decbot directory. In a terminal:

       	scp pass?.json declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/obsbot/   (get password from Kathy or any of the contacts above)
 
To start the bot:
- SISPI: Setup SISPI with propID *2014B-0404*. Do not use their new propID (2023A-*) because decbot does not have permission to send exposure request to SISPI with other propIDs
- Start a vncviewer (it is a special one, not the one we usually use). In another terminal:

  	ssh -X -Y declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu 
	cd
	./bin/vnc
	vncviewer :1   (same password we use for :7 or :3))

        The above will open a vncviewer which will have 3 windows running. Do not close any. Some plots will be generated automatically once observing starts

- When the time comes, start decbot. To do that, in a terminal (ssh -X -Y declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu, get password from Kathy/Alfredo) run:

        cd ~/obsbot/
        python2.7 -u decbot.py --exptime=80 | tee -a decbot-2023-11-01.log  (CHANGE THE DATE WITH THE START OF THE NIGHT DATE)

	That will start feeding the queue with 2 exposures at the time
	Click Go in the Observer Console. And that s it!

- During the night check the pointing and make corrections if values get larger than ~20 arcsec. You can see the pointing in one of the plots generated automatically in the vncviewer :1  (but do not use those numbers since they have the wrong sign to what the operators need. Better do center in kentools)
- Start/end the observing with Sun at -12
- At the end of night: (on the initial terminal you opened in your machine, not in the VNC)

	declsp@observer2% cd
	declsp@observer2% bin/end_of_night_no_internet 2023-10-04 firstScienceImage
	The end_of_night_no_internet script will close the vncviewer (do not close it yourself) and it will generate some summary plots. It takes some time. Be patient.
	Copy the resulting figures, say for 2023-10-04, to your computer: 

	scp declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/observing/logs/2023-10-04\*.png .
        scp declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/observing/obstatus/decam-tiles_obstatus.fits .

- *Upload those plots and file to the Google drive
- Run the following commands (in declsp@observer2):

      	bash
	cd ~/obsbot
	python2.7 copilot.py --fits=obs_decam.fits

- Copy the resulting file to your computer and upload it to the same google drive. It is ok to replace a file with the same name already in the drive.

       	scp declsp@observer2.ctio.noao.edu:~/obsbot/obs_decam.fits .

- Send an email with a summary of the night (any bad image? Anything in particular to report?) to the contact people above.


NOTE: if decbot fails, just run script pass1.json (in folder 2023B-307896). This option should be just a plan B because decbot will adjust the exposure time with current conditions. The script has a fixed exposure time.
