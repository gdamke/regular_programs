Not done - schedule in 30 min/1h chunks starting 03/27 - check sky brightness/verify schedule with Alex D-W

Notes from Alex D-W
30 minute chunks that can be started between 06:30 UTC and 09:00 UTC. 
These scripts can be observed in one night or spread over multiple nights. 
We are looking for dark time when the i-band zenith seeing is < 1.2 arcsec 
(these are i-band exposures near zenith, so the median fwhm should be ~0.9 arcsec). 

From a sky brightness perspective, we can't go much earlier tonight due to the moon or later due to twilight.
From an airmass standpoint you can push a bit earlier:
Scripts 01, 02, and 03 can be taken as early as 05:30 if necessary (airmass 1.4), but are best around 08:30 UTC (tonight)
Scripts 04 and 05 can be taken as early as 04:30 (airmass 1.4), but are best around 07:30 UTC (tonight)
All of these times will shift as we get farther from tonight
